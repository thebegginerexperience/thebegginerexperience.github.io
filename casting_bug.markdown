I'm seeking players to join me for **Course to the golden Bug**, a ttrpg actual-play stream, a monthly series using the **Pirate Borg** system.

## About Pirate Borg
A scurvy-ridden, rules light, art heavy tabletop RPG.
Inspired by history, fantasy, horror and rum. Your cutlass & flintlock won’t save you from the hordes of skeletons, the Kraken, or even your own crew. PIRATE BORG is a complete game based on and compatible with the award -winning MÖRK BORG RPG. But it’s also a tool kit. Most of the tables can be hacked and used with any tabletop RPG.


***Arghh!!***

*Find a ship. Recruit some crew. Raid, pillage, plunder, and otherwise pilfer your weasley black guts out. Get a bigger ship. Kill some things. Upgrade your ship. Sneak into a fort. Raid a port. Acquire treasure. Bury said treasure. Become infamous. Search for someone else’s treasure. Flee in terror from unfathomable creatures from the deep. Drink all of the rum. Die on the high seas. Roll a new character and do it all again.*

## Our Story
Olivier Levasseur, the infamous pirate known as La Buse, The Buzzard, plundered the seas and amassed one of the greatest treasure hoards in history. Jewels, gold, forbidden relics… enough wealth to drown a king.
Before his execution, as the noose tightened around his neck, La Buse hurled a necklace into the jeering crowd. On it hung a tiny glass vial containing a cryptic parchment. His final words echoed across the square:

*“My treasure to he who can understand…”*

For years, hunters, scholars, madmen, and cutthroats have pursued the riddle of La Buse’s lost fortune. None has claimed to have found it...

Now it’s your turn.

Will you unlock the code?
Will you seize the Buzzard’s gold?
Or will the same fate that claimed La Buse drag you to the depths?

**La Buse’s treasure awaits—if you dare.**

# Important Note on Tone
In Pirate Borg, you don’t start as legendary captains or feared buccaneers.
You start as drunken deckhands, starving castaways, gutter-born scum, and press-ganged nobodies.

***Most of you will die screaming.***
Some will drown.
Others will be shot, stabbed, cursed, or fed to things with far too many teeth.

*Don’t grow fond of your character. The sea won’t.*

## Logistics & Requirements

# Tech Requirements
**External Microphone (Essential):** good audio quality is paramount. You don't need a top-of-the-line studio mic, but a serviceable external USB microphone (or similar) that provides clear audio is a must. (No headset mics or laptop built-in mics, please.)

**Webcam:** we will use webcams during our sessions.

**Recording & Platforms:** Discord for meetup and main communication. Streaming to YouTube.

# Game Details

## Casting Process
**Step 1:** Fill out the sign-up form linked below.

**Step 2:** If your sign-up form is a good fit, you'll be invited to a short, unrecorded "vibe check" session where we'll do a quick tech check and play through a brief roleplaying scenario to see how everybody's styles mesh.
