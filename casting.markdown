I'm seeking four talented players to join me for **Funnel Me Once, Shame on You** *(Funnel me twice? I'm probably dead.)*, a high-quality, actual-play audio podcast mini-series using the **Dungeon Crawl Classics** system.

## About Dungeon Crawl Classics
DCC RPG is a fast-paced, open-feeling rules set that allows for epic game experiences without unnecessary tethers. It uses modern gameplay while paying homage to the origins of role-playing and the fun that inspired it.

***You’re no hero.***

*You’re an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets. You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.
Return to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role-Playing Game. Adventure as 1974 intended you to, with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery. Fast play, cryptic secrets, and a mysterious past await you…*

## Our Story
This adventure takes place on Cob Hill, in the environs of an old manor house with a dark past and an uncertain future. Two supernatural forces, one an ancient goddess of nature and the other a malignant force of Chaos, vie for power on the manor’s grounds, each seeking mortals to spread their influence and ensure their survival.

A group of villagers seeks family members gone mysteriously silent after accepting new positions at Cob Hill Manor, a place long abandoned but recently inhabited by Morto Blango, a distant relative of the original owner, who was allegedly Zatharides The Black, a legendary adventurer and wizard who was known before his untimely death to dabble in life magics and, if the dark rumors are true… necromancy.

# Important Note on Tone
Gameplay in the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game starts at 0 level: untrained, uneducated peasants. ***Most of these characters die pitiful deaths*** in a dungeon. Don’t get attached. Characters that survive their first dungeon, then choose classes, and become worth remembering
Logistics & Requirements

# Tech Requirements
**External Microphone (Essential):** This is an audio-only podcast; good audio quality is paramount. You don't need a top-of-the-line studio mic, but a serviceable external USB microphone (or similar) that provides clear audio is a must. (No headset mics or laptop built-in mics, please.)

**Webcam:** only the audio will be recorded for the podcast; we will use webcams during our sessions. This helps immensely with reading body language, visual cues, and generally makes for a more connected and engaging remote play experience.
Recording & Platforms: Discord for meetup and main communication, backup recording, and Audacity for offline recording.

## THE CASTING PROCESS
**Step 1:** Fill out the sign-up form linked below.

**Step 2:** If your sign-up form is a good fit, you'll be invited to a short, unrecorded "vibe check" session where we'll do a quick tech check and play through a brief roleplaying scenario to see how everybody's styles mesh.
Note: This does not mean you are in the cast just yet.

**Step 3:** After a successful vibe check, you'll receive an official invitation to the cast!

**Step 4:** Once the cast is set, we'll schedule our Session 0 to kick things off.
Shooting to officially get started mid-August and record every other week from there.
