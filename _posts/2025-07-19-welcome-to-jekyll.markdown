I’m a Game Master. A Conductor. A Dungeon Master. A Space Master. Whatever the game calls the person behind the screen, that’s me, the one juggling monsters, maps, NPCs, and story beats, trying to make something fun and meaningful for everyone at the table.

But before the dice hit the table, I’m a dad. A husband. A guy trying to do his best at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Life is busy, often messy, and games don’t always fit neatly into the schedule. But storytelling has always been my way of connecting. With my kids. With my friends. With myself.

This site? It’s a side project. Nothing fancy. I’m building it bit by bit, writing the code myself, in the quiet hours after bedtime and dishes and whatever else the day throws at me. There’s no grand plan, just the simple joy of sharing what I love.

*The Begginer Experience* is about that mindset, the one where every game feels like your first again. Not because you don’t know what you’re doing, but because you’re still curious. Still excited. Still learning. That’s what I want to hold onto.

So yeah, you’ll find actual plays, blog posts, and whatever else I manage to put together. But more than that, I hope you find something that reminds you why we do this in the first place, to play, to grow, and to share it with others.

Thanks for being here.
