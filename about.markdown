# About {{ site.title }}

Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

**I’m Sebastián**, a game master, storyteller, and tabletop RPG enthusiast.

My journey has taken me through countless systems and genres, from gritty survival to cosmic horror, and from post-apocalyptic wastelands to whimsical fantasy. I’ve run and played games across D&D West Marches-style Discord servers, one-shots, long-form campaigns, and actual plays.

As a game master, my focus is on player agency and world reactivity. Your choices matter, every action *(or inaction)* leaves a mark. I build worlds where lore deepens through play, where consequences unfold organically, and where character arcs emerge from the story you help shape.

Whether you're here to enjoy the stories I help bring to life or looking for inspiration to tell your own, this space is for you. I'm part of **Looking for Mom**, a group of creators passionate about celebrating the tabletop RPG hobby in all its forms. Through the games we play and the content we share, we aim to show that anyone can play, anyone can create, and that **every game, every table, is valid, meaningful, and fun in its own way.**
