### **What You'll Find Here**

Here, you'll get a window into my table: the characters I play, the games I run, and the lessons I learn along the way. I'm sharing my journey not as an expert, but as someone who's still exploring—still asking questions, still trying new things.

You’ll find actual play videos, reflections on sessions and systems, and blog posts that unpack what worked, what didn’t, and why. I’ll be opening up my toolbox—tips, techniques, and resources I’ve picked up or created—so you can use them to enrich your own games.

### **My Mission**
Through the games I play and the stories we share, I want to celebrate the idea that anyone can play, anyone can create, and that every table—no matter the system, style, or experience level—is valid, meaningful, and worth having fun at. Whether you're watching an actual play, reading a blog post, or just curious about TTRPGs, this is a space that embraces the joy of discovery and the power of play.

### **Join Me**
Whether you want to play with me, be featured in one of our shows, or just talk about the adventures we share, you're welcome here. Come be part of our tabletop community!
